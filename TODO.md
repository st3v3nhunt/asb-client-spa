## Features to implement

* Store form values client side to prevent having to re-enter them
* Pass the queue client to the app so it can be used by other components
* Validation on the input for 'Connection String' and 'Queue Name'
* Show available queues for the Service Bus
* Select the queue to use from the list
* Add errors to each element along with summary above them all
* Install Bulma rather than linking to the CDN version
